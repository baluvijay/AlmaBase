# AlmaBase

Mapping file will have values in pairs. The first one is the source key and second one is destination key.
If the 2nd one does not exist in destination, then the patch will direct the creation of that field.
Important: Mapping list should always have id mapping.

Patch file would be a message explaining how to convert the source to destination.
